### Setup

First of all, you must have [cordova installed](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html)

Cordova plugins are not tracked in the version control. There must be initialized:

Initialize Android platform:

  cordova platform add android

Whitelist plugin:

  cordova plugin add https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist.git

### Run the application in the Android emulator

  cordova emulate android

### Debugging the app in Android

The app can be accessed and debugged using [Weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre-docs/latest/Home.html)

In the project root, copy the config.js.sample to your config.js

  cp config.js.sample config.js

Edit config.js and change the line

  config.weinre = true;

Restart the server

  gulp

You can access weinre from your browser at:

  http://[external-ip]:8080/client/#anonymous

Being `external-ip` with the ip of your internet device (eth0, wlan0, etc..)

### Releasing and signing the apk

You need to get the keystore from your organization private repo or generate your own.

Then copy build.json.example to build.json

  cp build.json.example build.json

And customize it with the path to the keystore

To build the package:

  cordova build --release

The package will be stored at `cordova/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release.apk`
